Features
Jenkins Integration: Automated build and deployment pipelines.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing AWS resources.
Docker: Containerization of applications for consistent environments.
AWS: Cloud infrastructure for high availability and scalability.
Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture:

Jenkins Pipeline:

Triggers on code commits.
Executes Terraform scripts for infrastructure setup.
Builds Docker images and pushes them to a container registry.
Deploys Docker containers to AWS services (e.g., ECS, EKS).
Terraform Scripts:

Defines AWS infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, etc.).
Provisions necessary resources for running Docker containers.
Docker:

Containerizes applications for easy deployment and scaling.
AWS:
# Base image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the project dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the Flask application will be listening on
EXPOSE 5000

# Set environment variables, if necessary
# ENV MY_ENV_VAR=value

# Run the Flask application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
